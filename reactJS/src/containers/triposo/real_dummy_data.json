It is made with thin yellow noodles stir fried in cooking oil with garlic, onion or shallots, fried prawn, chicken, beef, or sliced bakso (meatballs), chili, Chinese cabbage, cabbages, tomatoes, egg, and other vegetables. Ubiquitous in Indonesia, it is sold by food vendors from street-hawkers, <i>warungs</i>, to high-end restaurants. It is an Indonesian one-dish meal favourite, although street food hawkers commonly sell it together with <i><a data-id=\"Nasi_goreng\" data-object_type=\"article\">nasi goreng</a></i> (fried rice). It is commonly available at Mamak stalls in Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia and is often spicy. In Sri Lanka, mee goreng is a popular dish due to <a data-id=\"Sri_Lankan_Malays\" data-object_type=\"article\">Malay cultural influences</a> and is sold at street food stalls around the country.",

The dish is derived from Chinese <i>chow mein</i> and believed to have been introduced by Chinese immigrants in Indonesia. Despite being influenced by Chinese cuisine, <i>mie goreng</i> in Indonesia have a definite Indonesian taste, it has been more heavily integrated into Indonesian cuisine; for example the application of popular sweet soy sauce that add mild sweetness, sprinkle of fried shallots, addition of spicy <i>sambal</i> and the absence of pork and lard in favour of shrimp, chicken, or beef; to cater for the Muslim majority.\nAsian stir fried noodle akin to <i>mie goreng</i> is arguably can trace its origin to China. In Malaysia and Singapore however, the dish is believed to have been created by Indian immigrants who drew influences from their own as well as other cultures. <i>Mee Goreng</i>, which is fried yellow noodles commonly found in Malaysia, is commonly sold in Mamak stall; <i>Mamak</i> is a local term for Muslim Malaysian Indians hawkers. The <i>Mamaks</i> borrowed noodles from their Chinese counterparts and create their own spicy version. The naming in Malay: <i>mee goreng</i> is also meant to signify that it is a halal food; cooked by Indian-Muslim in Malaysia, in contrast to <a data-id=\"Malaysian_Chinese\" data-object_type=\"article\">Malaysian Chinese</a> version that often non-halal and retain its original Chinese names. The Malaysian Indian <i>mee goreng mamak</i> is a Malaysian phenomenon, since this version cannot be found in India itself.</p>",

However, although quality can be excellent, genuine branded goods or quality products are expensive.\nEvery year, the Provincial Government of Jakarta holds an annual <b>Festival Jakarta Great Sale</b> that takes place from Mid-June to Mid-July. Most markets, shopping malls, and department stores attend it and will give discounts on selected items, although the event itself might be barely noticeable aside from some banners. Some stores also run Midnight Sales, usually in the weekend. And most of the malls are open from 10:00-20:00 every day, except on Ied Day when they're open 13:30-22:00.</p>",

Shopping options are on the middle floors, followed by a selection of higher-end restaurants and potentially a movie theater at the top floors. Expect each location to have one or more lobbies at which you can be dropped off, and one of these lobbies will usually include a taxi stand.
