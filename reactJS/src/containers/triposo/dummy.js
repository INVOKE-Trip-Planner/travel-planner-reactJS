This is a very extensive survey work which consists of 45 performances of the original picture, nine scenes of a dove, three landscapes and a portrait of Jacqueline.\nPicasso himself understood this series as a whole and as such donated it to the museum in Barcelona in May 1968 in memory of <a data-id=\"Jaime_SabartC3A9s\" data-object_type=\"article\">Jaime Sabart\u00e9s</a> who died the same year. Picasso said to Sabart\u00e9s in 1950:\nIf someone want to copy Las Meninas, entirely in good faith, for example, upon reaching a certain point and if that one was me, I would say..what if you put them a little more to the right or left? I'll try to do it my way, forgetting about Vel\u00e1zquez. The test would surely bring me to modify or change the light because of having changed the position of a character.

The painting became part of the collection of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and is exhibited at the Girona premises of the Catalan Government.\nDue to the large size of the work, scholars suggest that it may have been an effort to compete with <a data-id=\"MariC3A0_Fortuny\" data-object_type=\"article\">Mari\u00e0 Fortuny</a>'s Battle of Tetuan, a work commissioned by the council of Barcelona regarding the African War.\nIn 1938 during the Spanish Civil War, the painting was damaged during a bombardment while on exhibit at the Palau de les Belles Arts (Palace of the Fine Arts).

These competitions combined works of historical subject matter with epic and romantic content. In 1667, Andr\u00e9 Felibien, historian and theoretician of French Classicism, created a hierarchy of pictorial themes and ranked historical paintings in first place.\nMart\u00ed Alsina first participated in the competition in 1858, when he was awarded a third-class medal for one of his submissions entitled <i>Estudi del Natural</i> (Study of Nature). Later the same year, he presented a work entitled \"<i>L\u2019\u00faltim dia de Num\u00e0ncia</i>\" (\"The Last Days of Numantia\") outside of the competition, which was later purchased by the state for 3,000 pesetas and given to the Prado Museum. In 1860, he submitted a landscape to the Exposici\u00f3 Nacional de Belles Arts and was awarded a second-class medal.\nMart\u00ed Alsina spent most of his life obsessed with themes such as the <i>Guerra del Fr\u00e0nces (Peninsular War) and the Siege of Girona,</i>creating such works as<i> El somatent del Bruch</i>, <i>La Companyia de <a data-id=\"Santa_BC3A0rbara2C_Tarragona\" data-object_type=\"location\">Santa B\u00e0rbara</a></i> (The Company of Saint Barbara), <i>Les hero\u00efnes de Girona</i> (The Heroines of Girona) and, his best, the <i>\u00c9l gran dia De Girona</i> (The Great Day of Girona). <i>The Great Day of Girona</i> took the painter most of his life and until his death to complete.</p>", "image": {"source_id": "wikipedia", "source_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Ramon_Mart%C3%AD_i_Alsina_-_The_Company_of_Saint_Barbara_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "owner": "Ramon Mart\u00ed i Alsina (1826 - 1894)\nBorn in Barcelona.

Mart\u00ed Alsina located a large studio space, called the \"Casino de Sants,\" to accommodate his project. The premises are believed to have been situated in building number 300 of the high street in the neighbourhood of Sants, an address consistent with the documentation of the work in 1882. The artist brought various types of armour, weapons and historical objects to the studio to achieve the highest degree of standard in his work. He also utilized dozens of models whom he dressed in costumes specifically made for the occasion. Mart\u00ed Alsina also visited Girona repeatedly, as can be observed from the hundreds of surviving sketches he made of the city. Some of these sketches are currently held in private collections while others are stored in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC) and the Museum of Art Girona.\nMart\u00ed Alsina's first attempts occurred in 1859, as confirmed by a letter sent to him from Girona dated 14 October 1859. The letter was a response to information solicited by the artist regarding flags and other details that would be included in the work; the painter wished the final result to be as realistic as possible. Due to the fact that he ordered a frame for the work to be made in March 1864, it is believed that his intention was to send the work to the National Exhibition of Fine Arts that year. However, when Mart\u00ed Alsina received critical comments from friends regarding the piece, he decided instead to continue working on the canvas. He never signed the finished work, which remained in his studio during his lifetime.\nYears later, Mart\u00ed Alsina took advantage of some of the research material and sketches he had accumulated to create two works relating to the Siege of Girona -- <i>Heroines of Girona</i>, which was displayed in the 1868 Society of Exhibitions of the Fine Arts in Barcelona (<i>Sociedad para Exposiciones de Bellas Artes, Barcelona</i>) and <i>The Company of Saint Barbara</i>, which was displayed in the 1891 exhibition of the Palace of Fine Arts (<i>Palau de les Belles Arts</i>).\nPersonal documents confirm that Mart\u00ed Alsina used <i>The</i> <i>Great Day of Girona</i> to guarantee a debt of 20,000 pesetas that he owed to Pau Borrell. As the painter was not able to settle the loan, Borrell assumed temporary ownership of the work. In 1894 Mart\u00ed Alsina came to an agreement with the heirs of Borrell and succeeded in regaining ownership of the work in exchange for 14 others. An article published during that time in <i>El Divulio</i> claims that Mart\u00ed Alsina subsequently attempted to sell the work to the City Council of Barcelona for a sum of 15,000 pesetas.</p>", "image": null}, {"title": "Title", "body": "<p>Although <i>The Great Day of Girona</i> is the painting's most common title and its name in the catalogue of the MNAC, the work is sometimes referred to as <i>The Defenders of Girona</i>.

The work, however, was first exhibited in 1898 as part of an exhibition organised to display the works of deceased artists. After this exhibition, the work was deposited in the Hall of Queen Regent in the Museum of Fine Arts, Barcelona (Museu Munincipal de Belles Arts de Barcelona) and later transferred to the Museum of Decorative Arts and Archaeology (<i>Museu d\u2019Arts Decoratives i Arqueol\u00f2gic</i>). The work was still in storage by 1904, which sparked Font i Sangr\u00e0 to question whether it was due to a lack of exhibition space or location that the work remained unseen (\"si per manca de local no pot ser exposada\"). Carles Bofarull, director of the Museum of Fine Arts, responded:\n\t<i><small>Comunicaci\u00f3 del Director dels Museus de Belles Arts a la Junta de Museus, 16-8-1904</small></i>\t\nIn 1905, Font i Sangr\u00e0 reclaimed the painting and, due to its dimensions, decided to hang it in a chapel (specially extended for the occasion) on his personal property in Cardadeu, Ca n\u2019Eres Vall. While he kept the bulk of his personal collection at his home (38 Ronda de Sant Pere), <i>The Great Day of Girona</i> became somewhat of a tourist attraction in Cardadeu, as Font i Sagr\u00e0 took pleasure in showing the work to all who came to see it. After some negotiation, the painting became the property of the City Council of Barcelona as a legacy and was accepted on 18 June 1929. The painting was subsequently added to the collection of the Palace of Fine Arts and put on permanent display in the Hall of Queen Regent. When the MNAC was created in 1934, many of the works from the Palace of Fine Arts were transferred to the National Palace; however, those of larger measurements such as <i>The Great Day of Girona</i> remained in the Palace of Fine Arts.\nIn 1938 during the Spanish Civil War, the Palace of Fine Arts was used as a location for meetings and conferences, and that summer, the glass building was the victim of a bombardment that destroyed its roof. The destruction caused damage to <i>The Great Day of Girona</i>, including cracks extending over five meters. Once the war ended, it was decided that until the work could be restored, due to its extraordinary size, it would be rolled up and stored for its protection at the MNAC. Restoration commenced in 2009.</p>", "image": {"source_id": "wikipedia", "source_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/El_Gran_dia_de_Girona_al_Palau_de_les_Belles_Arts.jpg", "owner": "Generalitat de Catalunya.

The painting was realised on a single piece of canvas cloth without the use of seams and weighs approximately 70kg. Textile experts believe it may be the same type of fabric used in the production of boat sails. Other studies suggest that the fabric may have been acquired in Maresme or Poblenou, where the artist had another workshop.\nThe work portrays the aftermath of the battle that took place on 19 September 1809, during the Peninsular War, when the invading army tried one final attack against the city of Girona. The attack was resisted on the orders of General \u00c1lvarez de Castro. The architecture of the scene confirms that the painting depicts the location of the events: The towers of the Cathedral of Girona and the church of St. Felix can be seen in the background, the walls of the city and the Gironella Tower zone are in front. Preparatory drawings indicate that Mart\u00ed Alsina chose to depict the battle scene in the area of <i>La caserna dels Alemanys</i> (the headquarters of the Germans) in order to simultaneously paint a classical profile of the city of Girona and depict a location where other important battles of the siege had taken place.\nAlthough stylistically Mart\u00ed Alsina is commonly compared to Courbet and <a data-id=\"Realism_28arts29\" data-object_type=\"article\">realism</a> (a movement which the painter introduced to Catalonia), <i>The Great Day of Girona</i> is closer to <a data-id=\"Romanticism\" data-object_type=\"article\">Romanticism</a>.\nMart\u00ed Alsina's pictorial composition resembles that of French historical painter Horace Vernes. Both artists produced a great quantity of preliminary sketches from different perspectives to effectively depict a mass of figures within their final works.Chill\u00f3n, 2010, p. 247.\nMart\u00ed Alsina had visited a retrospective exhibition organised as part of the Universal Exhibition of 1855, viewing historical paintings by Vernet, Ingres, <a data-id=\"EugC3A8ne_Delacroix\" data-object_type=\"article\">Delacroix</a> and Alexandre Gabriel Decamps.\nThe work is divided into three planes. The figures in the foreground are the most realistic and dramatic and are treated with more lively colours. The figures in the middle ground of the work are less defined, and those in the background are only suggested and seem to fade into the architecture as if in a fog.Chill\u00f3n, 2010, p. 335.\nThe scenes on the right-hand side are arranged in a pyramid shape, with the apex situated in the ruins of the background of the picture plane. The left-hand side of the pyramid is formed by the entrenched defenders and forms a line that cuts the entire space in a diagonal line and that draws attention to the military figures, despite their placement in the middle plane.\nThe group of figures situated in the left-hand side is formed by the last line of defenders of the city, with General Alvarez de Castro prominently portrayed.\nThe composition is similar to that of Vernet\u2019s <i>Battle of Somosierra</i> of 1812, where the mountain in the background frames the figures on horseback and creates a competition of importance with the wounded foreground figures.\nIn the bottom section of <i>The Great Day of Girona</i>, or the foreground of the battle, the wounded and dead are depicted, employing maximum realism for the most dramatic images. One figure, situated at the centre of the composition, below the figure of the General, represents the same type of female figure as found in another of Mart\u00ed Alsina\u2019s works, <i>The Company of Saint Barbara.</i> She is typical of military bodies, who assist the wounded in battle. She wears a red ribbon tied in a loop on her left arm, distinguishing her as an aide. More of these similar female aid-figures can be observed \u2013 some helping the injured and others distributing food and drink.\nAt the extreme right, the retreating French Army can be seen, the figures blurred to such an extent that they avoid important presence in the composition.", "image": {"source_id": "wikipedia", "source_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Vernet_Battle_of_Somosierra.jpg", "owner": "Horace Vernet", "owner_url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vernet_Battle_of_Somosierra.jpg", "license": "Public domain", "caption": "Battle of Somosierra by Horace Vernet", "attribution": {"format": "{attribution} / {license}", "attribution_text": "Horace Vernet", "attribution_link": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vernet_Battle_of_Somosierra.jpg", "license_text": "Public domain", "license_link": null}, "sizes": {"original": {"url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Vernet_Battle_of_Somosierra.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 742, "bytes": 438802, "format": "jpg"}, "medium": {"url": "http://api-images-www.triposo.com/20200803/gAAAAABfRIPwBAC6D8hIqK814Hs3O7hAOxXMJvDNZ_qdyY9CdFSuoNXqrICKIUOd5pNxcwny9_jMsRU967SWmI4PmFyg6Wy--GDhqvGtThj2gT4aS685VwDzJbudBhz0lzdJWkFuSvHbLX6q1gvpgYeQVp2IH3mgbaZR7lFt27Jdrantr4iz17h5aRIMC-6bOm3GsL5wUWW9zeIQAqMigUpjfSJ8Jy85AkC3N-HiakhKTYxBxhifjpOyh4NCIQoqOueT0bdfFSQDXu9WtwCdR924BP4PW8DGEEGVrbWXj1bFhNOSgnTDSWI=", "width": 640, "height": 474, "bytes": 51860, "format": "jpg"}, "thumbnail": {"url": "http://api-images-www.triposo.com/20200803/gAAAAABfRIPwwsVzoh_F5gJs09FGM2Bs6m9_u1ZM08ZIkglRj4cBUtv1LlZHlHwqM5q1WuUzugF3ssYUDNWeVl5vG_s3gzGStR3qUy6fM-2vwi8-yexefQIrfaAuO0VbLgznxxSgcZ2m3V1N3cH9YPs5nDepc9T-YGEe3n0WS7mpIA7DsK6xTFXDDXeqkWrYwfDMZ6s4XyXjImW9AwUyxmhlBzi3DpH-idJJMk8KaKaXWljRLFhp-3LvUTb5ugD6qScYRL4cJi2rrVInEsNtn0-VMs7fKJDnww==", "width": 192, "height": 142, "bytes": 7968, "format": "jpg"}}}}, {"title": "Exhibition", "body": "<p>The painting has been exhibited publicly in two locations.

The artist brought various types of armour, weapons and historical objects to the studio to achieve the highest degree of standard in his work. He also utilized dozens of models whom he dressed in costumes specifically made for the occasion. Mart\u00ed Alsina also visited Girona repeatedly, as can be observed from the hundreds of surviving sketches he made of the city. Some of these sketches are currently held in private collections while others are stored in the <a data-id=\"T__18939fdf4b71\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya</a> (MNAC) and the Museum of Art Girona.</p>\n<p>Mart\u00ed Alsina's first attempts occurred in 1859, as confirmed by a letter sent to him from Girona dated 14 October 1859.

The architecture of the scene confirms that the painting depicts the location of the events: The towers of the Cathedral of Girona and the church of St. Felix can be seen in the background, the walls of the city and the Gironella Tower zone are in front. Preparatory drawings indicate that Mart\u00ed Alsina chose to depict the battle scene in the area of <i>La caserna dels Alemanys</i> (the headquarters of the Germans) in order to simultaneously paint a classical profile of the city of Girona and depict a location where other important battles of the siege had taken place.</p>\n<p>Although stylistically Mart\u00ed Alsina is commonly compared to Courbet and <a data-id=\"Realism_28arts29\" data-object_type=\"article\">realism</a> (a movement which the painter introduced to Catalonia), <i>The Great Day of Girona</i> is closer to <a data-id=\"Romanticism\" data-object_type=\"article\">Romanticism</a>.</p>\n<p>Mart\u00ed Alsina's pictorial composition resembles that of French historical painter Horace Vernes.

The similarities between Llimona's <i>Desconsol</i> and Rodin\u2019s <i>Danaid</i> lie primarily in the modeling technique used by the artist, the composition of the figure, and the thoughtful use of light and shadow.\nLlimona's masterful work arises from a block of stone, but the softness and roundness of its forms contrasts strongly with the roughness of the material. The female figure evokes contained melancholy that can be perceived subtly; her pose hides much of the inner world of the character. Her face, covered by a thick mass of hair, is unknown.

Although this style wasn't adopted in all the works, female figures predominate and their formal characteristics passed into the artistic language used by modernist sculptors in the works they produced for collectors, without those elements more suited to funerary images associated with death.Do\u00f1ate, Merc\u00e8. <i>Modernisme in the MNAC Collections</i>. <a data-id=\"T__18939fdf4b71\" data-object_type=\"poi\">Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya</a> and Lunwerg, Spain 2012.</p>\n<p><i>Desolation</i> is full of feeling, an aspect in the Symbolist vein.

Together with the interest shown in treating the figures with expression and representing portraits, there is an apparent trend and interest in a Franco-gothic style of painting.\nThe first panel where the narration commences \u2013 from left to right- is identified as the \u2018Courts of Barcelona\u2019. The representation is observed in the depiction of the walls of Barcelona, from which rise the bell tower of the cathedral. There is also group of people depicted, which probably corresponds to the meeting of parliament which was held in December 1228 to decide the details of the military assault on Majorca.\nFragments of a painting are also seen which may correspond to the scene of a naval battle.\nThe second panel corresponds to the depiction of the \u2018Battle of Porto Pi\u2019. On 11 September 1229 James I diploid his troops in the Bay of Santa Ponsa, that same day the decisive battle of Portop\u00ed against the Muslims took place. The background of the panel is rendered with mountains and trees, in the mountains a group of Moors are depicted whereas in the foreground the battle is observed, the battle in which Guillem II de Montcada i de Bearn met his death. He is shown riding his horse and brandishing a sword and shield where the coat of arms of his lineage appear; the bessants of Montcada and the oxen of Bearn, which are also found represented on his horses\u2019 caparison. Gillem II is being pursued by an unidentified knight, heading towards the Saracen troops; as found in the description of these events chronicled by Bernat Desclot.\nThe final panel shows the \u2018Royal Camp and the attack on the city of Majorca\u2019. The camp is shown on the right hand side with the royal tent of yellow and red. James I is depicted in the foreground, represented in the centre of a group of knights. On James I's left stand three representatives, one of which has been identified as Nun\u00f3 San\u00e7, count of Rosell\u00f3. To the right hand side King Guilabert de Cru\u00eflles is depicted, wearing a red helmet with a white cross and his hand resting on the knee of King James I. The bishop of Barcelona stands to the right of Guilabert shown wearing his mitre, and to his side the knight Ramon de Centells is found. The tent situated to the left of the King's, with the horizontal red stripes, is that of the Count of Empurias Hug V d\u2019Emp\u00faries, who is found conversing with the Aragonese knight Pero Ma\u00e7a de Sangarr\u00e9n. They are shown separated from the other group and the King this representation being true to the accounts which tell of the Count d\u2019Emp\u00faries\u2019 disagreement with King James I. \nThe spaces between the two depicted tents and the figures of the composition were filled with the suggestion of other tents, creating the pictorial notion of a vast army camp.\nThe assault on Medina Mayurqa is represented beneath the depiction of the royal tent. Here what could be described as a trebuchet is depicted and to its side a group of soldiers who are heading towards the city who find themselves clashing with a group of Saracens.\nA wall with towers surrounding a city full of houses, in the centre of which the castle of Almundaina can be seen, protected by a double wall.\nThe nearest tower to the camp has been assaulted by two men bearing the Royal crest and who are shown fighting against two Moors, whilst the other towers depicted in the distance are still being defended by the Saracens.</p>", "image": {"source_id": "wikipedia", "source_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Corts-barcelona-desembre-1228.jpg", "owner": "Anonymous", "owner_url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Corts-barcelona-desembre-1228.jpg", "license": "Public domain", "caption": "The meeting of the counts in Barcelona, December 1228", "attribution": {"format": "{attribution} / {license}", "attribution_text": "Anonymous", "attribution_link": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Corts-barcelona-desembre-1228.jpg", "license_text": "Public domain", "license_link": null}, "sizes": {"original": {"url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Corts-barcelona-desembre-1228.jpg", "width": 495, "height": 700, "bytes": 246213, "format": "jpg"}, "medium": {"url": "http://api-images-www.triposo.com/20200803/gAAAAABfRIPw2HD8mZ8n1JXw8E83zz-6b2kEtEdLjSa4-mN0KebfYB1N1dQy8StOk4rxYR-b7SUD4YfWryRLj47YGOEfTLdCHPwWggoPWvJBRMIjKdPITBa8iDfCPCEl3BG0puXdLQ1Uksroy3zkmy9tqx53vs6_MSE2X_n8TgWuJ1yy_V-hyyA4Pvzd6Sdq5pQy-OVbNF0n9s-rg4M5SGOGLy3j8GQSw-__yPo7EO-_CaReibWf2jsv8kgsZVm2Fg9DLBSbFFd-rLvJRVZ4P0958u1vnPiBbUlhIKU7FD7mcyxqfNek3UE=", "width": 452, "height": 640, "bytes": 88483, "format": "jpg"}, "thumbnail": {"url": "http://api-images-www.triposo.com/20200803/gAAAAABfRIPwYlozvg82Uy4v_cXXfCkEJyEe1mNb0vE4dT9LdmwMmSTfHL272tvPRoTAMLLvYbB06MIqNotQ4JHQfQyuRqfy-gGGQsMwAe2xsgodOsARJOWITRgc-qYI6El554XIE8QwL09g-tIQGWxOOOM3dSW1I4cLh16JsoGwTaljewtvDh0JsWfDigLIK4bDe3Nlr2WAmBztonVOvLcv8VyJnAHNt_p-keOgN9CkWN5ciRLoEMHZkScttWJw4ZBvvBq_lkoO55AMt5inMwCcqwefWxyzvg==", "width": 136, "height": 192, "bytes": 11644, "format": "jpg"}}}}, {"title": "Style", "body": "<p>These paintings pertain to the military genre of historical painting or profane works in commemoration of heroic feats and gestures. A similar example of the same era is a painting found on a vaulted niche conserved in MNAC, belonging to Saint Vincent of Cardona, where the siege of Girona (1285)/ The defense of Girona (1285) is depicted. This event was also described in the chronicles of Bernat Desclot. It is one the works that could be attributed to the master of the Conquest of Majorca. A little later, during the beginning of the 14th century, there are other works in a similar style of linear gothic which are found in the tower of the castle of Alcany\u00eds, which portray the Conquest of Valencia by James I.\nThe stylistic affinity is clear when these paintings are compared with the murals of the Palau Reial Major; both date from between 1285 and 1290, and both of which, in addition to the same subject, were realised using the majority of colours of red, blue, black and ochre, with a linear stroke deeply marked in black.\nThis narrative of the painting is depicted in reverse to that of its written version, that is, from right to left, with great affinity in its narrative.\nThere has been no conclusion as to which of the two series of paintings was realised first; that of the Palau Reail Major or, that of the Palau Aguilar.\nThat of the Palau Reial Major may have been the first to be painted as the style of the work is found to be more epic and monumental in its representation of the military parades; the figures being depicted as more compact than those found in the work of Palau Aguilar.\nThe work of Palau Aguilar more creative freedom can be observed, a creative freedom that perhaps would not have been apt for the destiny as a mural for a royal reception hall.\nThe coincidence that these murals were executed in the same style and subject matter in both palaces was resolved with the discovery that Dol\u00e7e de Caldes, daughter of Bernat de Caldes (owner of Palau Aguiler), at the time of the death of King <a data-id=\"Alfonso_III_of_Aragon\" data-object_type=\"article\">Alfonso the Candid</a>, was pregnant with Alfonso's child.
